* Run the files using command line, ie, *Teriminal* in MacOs and Linux and *Command Prompt* in Windows.

* Navigate into the the directory, in which the files are located using *cd* command. eg:
         
           cd Desktop

## Numpy

Numpy is a library used specifically for advanced and faster data manipulation in Python. It allows us to effectively manage and manipulate our datasets with minimal programming. In this document, we will have a look at what are the most commonly used features of Numpy and how can we exploit them to optimize our Python programming. 
### Arrays

#### 2-D Arrays

We can create 2-D Numpy arrays as `a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])` and this would lead to a 2 dimensional array with 2 rows and 3 columns. 

On this object, the attribute `shape` represents the dimensions. It can be used as `a.shape` to return `(2,3)` meaning **2 rows** and **3 columns** exist in this 2D array.
